I'm a curious and passionate learner with a wide range of interests in technology and beyond. I love exploring new tools, languages, and frameworks, and I'm always diving into something new that excites me. My goal is to keep growing and experimenting.

- ðŸ”­ Right now, I'm exploring a variety of topicsâ€”whatever sparks my curiosity and helps me grow. I believe in learning by doing, so I'm constantly building small projects, experimenting, and sharing what I learn along the way.
